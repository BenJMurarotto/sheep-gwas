GWAS – from clean data to functional interpretation.

3 files attached – the map file, actual genotypes and a file with the phenotypes. It all lines up, so should be quite easy to run.
The genotypes are from sheep and the map has been set on the latest version of the assembly.
The phenotypes are residuals after adjusting for fixed effects (make sure to discuss what this means in the report). It is not a real phenotype. 

Analysis suggestions:
Run a GWAS
Build a manhattan plot of results
Identify top SNP
Map the top ones to the genomic region and search for neighbouring genes (get a list of those). 
Summarize the genes you found (what do they do).

Note: do not expect great results or anything meaningful from the gene list, it’s too small a dataset for real applications (and there’s some data fudging as well!). But it is not too large to handle – should be quite manageable on any computer. 
An example of a GWAS paper is also attached - for reference purposes only.
